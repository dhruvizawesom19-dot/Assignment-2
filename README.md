Assignment 2: Advanced Data Representation Dhruv Patel

This assignments goal is to creat a number mapping program that can convert numbers between hex, octal, and binary number bases.
To use this program, you must download and open the repository in your IDE of choice. 
I chose VSCode. First, you must compile the code if you are only taking the .C files and not the compiled files. 
For compiling, you must compile both the main.c and convert.c files together Compile using clang main.c convert.c -o main.
Then I ran the file main by: ./main This created the new file output.txt with the output of the code.

Some challenges I ran into for this assignment were number mapping, buffers, and parsing as it is always a complicated subject for me. 
I always seem to run into issues when trying to parse a file rather than having direct user input. 
Although, I am glad that this project requires the parsing of a test file so i can practice other forms of input and output rather than to the terminal
